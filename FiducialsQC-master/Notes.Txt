How Matt's Code works

Order of operations

1. GetExcel
2. ReadDataFrame
3. Transform Coordinates
4. QualityControl
5. CreateXML 
6. HeightPlotter
7. FiducialComparison


How each works

GetExcel - Gets the Excel File from the website. 
Is used in FiducialComparison to find and read the files


2) ReadDataFrame - 

Creates the file that is later read. Reads the Excel File

Init -

sets up the various open lists that can be used
setdefaultHXY - sets the default 25 heights

GetColumn -

creates a column (?)

checkColums -

No idea


getComponents - 

helps decide which version of the  we are using




sortTuple - 

sorts the tuple so it goes, top right, top left, bottom right, bottom left

I have no idea how this actually works




ReadComponentHeights

Pulls the components

attribute uses getColumn










ReadComponentFiducials

readComponentHeights
